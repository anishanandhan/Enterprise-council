Excellent. Before we write a single line of implementation code, we need a **system blueprint** that both you and VS Code/Copilot can understand.

Think of this as our project's constitution.

# Actual User Flow

Suppose this happens:

```text
Employee downloaded 20GB
```

Splunk receives:

```text
download.log
```

---

## Step 1

Splunk Stores Data

```text
Index: security

Event:
User=John
Action=Download
Size=20GB
Time=09:00
```

---

## Step 2

MCP Fetches Context

Agent requests:

```text
Get user history
Get device history
Get related alerts
```

MCP runs SPL queries.

Example:

```spl
index=security user=john
```

Returns results.

---

## Step 3

Digital Twin Updates

System builds:

```text
John
 │
 ├── Laptop-01
 │
 ├── GitHub
 │
 ├── AWS
 │
 └── Database-X
```

Now we understand relationships.

---

## Step 4

Agent Council Begins

### Security Agent

Analyzes:

```text
Download Size
Past Behavior
Risk Indicators
```

Response:

```text
High Risk
Possible Exfiltration
```

---

### Infrastructure Agent

Analyzes:

```text
Affected Services
System Dependencies
```

Response:

```text
Blocking user may disrupt deployment
```

---

### Compliance Agent

Analyzes:

```text
Audit Requirements
Retention Rules
```

Response:

```text
Preserve evidence first
```

---

### Business Agent

Analyzes:

```text
Employee Role
Business Criticality
```

Response:

```text
User is deployment lead
```

---

## Step 5

Council Debate

Instead of:

```text
One AI deciding
```

we do:

```text
Security says:
Block immediately

Business says:
Avoid disruption

Compliance says:
Collect evidence

Infrastructure says:
Assess dependencies
```

---

## Step 6

Consensus Engine

Combines all opinions.

Produces:

```text
Recommended Action:

1. Restrict privileged access

2. Preserve evidence

3. Continue monitoring

4. Escalate to analyst

Confidence: 89%
```

---

## Step 7

Impact Simulation

System predicts:

```text
If blocked:

Production Risk = 60%

Security Risk = 10%
```

```text
If monitored:

Production Risk = 5%

Security Risk = 40%
```

Compares outcomes.

---

## Step 8

Final Decision

```text
Recommended Strategy:

Temporary restriction
Enhanced monitoring
Forensic collection
```

---

## Step 9

UI Displays

Panel 1

```text
Digital Twin Graph
```

Panel 2

```text
Agent Debate
```

Panel 3

```text
Impact Simulation
```

Panel 4

```text
Final Recommendation
```

Goal:

```text
Generate independent opinions
```

---

### Milestone 5

Council Debate

Goal:

Goal:

```text
Visualize
Twin
Debate
Decision
```

---

### Milestone 8

Hackathon Demo

Goal:

```text
3-minute winning story
```

# Most Important Thing

Our project is NOT:

```text
AI + Splunk
```

Our project is:

```text
Splunk Data
       ↓
Digital Twin
       ↓
AI Council
       ↓
Negotiation
       ↓
Consensus
       ↓
Impact Prediction
       ↓
Decision Intelligence
```

That sentence should appear in your README, architecture diagram, project description, and demo video because it is the core identity of the project.
